# The Suck Zone

## A storm chasing blog, generated with Jekyll

Live at https://www.schrockwell.com/storm-blog/

Last working with Ruby 3.2.2 and Jekyll 4.3.3.

Posts are written in Textile, so the `jekyll-textile-converter` plugin is required.

The generated `_site` output is copied over to https://github.com/schrockwell/gemini.rockwellschrock.com/tree/main/web/storm-blog
