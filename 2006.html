	<h1>2006 &ndash; Silver Lining Tours</h1>
	<p>
		In 2006 I chased on the Plains from June 18&ndash;23. I travelled with Roger Hill and the Silver Lining Tours crew. We spend most of the time in central and northern Nebraska, but also ended up in Kansas and northeastern Colorado.

		Despite a frustrating season for all chasers, Roger gave us a great show. A lack of sufficient moisture was the main obstacle to mesoscale development during this week.
