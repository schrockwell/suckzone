Hey everyone. I didn't want to start studying for final exams just yet, so instead I made this weblog to keep track of my trip out west this summer.

My internship at the NSSL begins on May 26. If the weather works out, I'll be taking a few extra days to travel and chase down some storms beforehand. Right now, I'm estimating my departure will be around May 19.

I set up a Twitter account named suckzone for rapid-fire updates from the field, so you can more easily follow without a lot of tweets dilluting your feed.

Also, I may migrate all the old "Storm Chasing for Dummies" posts here.
