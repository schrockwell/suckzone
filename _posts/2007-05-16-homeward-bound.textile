Soooooo today had an extremely slight chance for storms in Wisconsin and Illinois. We slept in too late and decided it was too late to drive out west that far, in addition to being more distance we'd just have to backtrack in the future. The chance for severe weather was just too small, so we headed home.

There is nothing else to report. Tonight we are sleeping at Vassar College, where Jake's sister has taken us in. We'll be home tomorrow night.

Oh, and nothing happened in Wisconsin or Illinois today. Whew.
