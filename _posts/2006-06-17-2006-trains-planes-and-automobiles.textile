Just checking in from Logan! I'm here excessively early, as always, with over an hour to kill. I'm taking United flight 267 at 11:20. Everything is going smoothly so far. My carry-on bag was screened at the security check-in, probably due to the excessive electronic gear inside (laptop, camera, iPod, Nintendo DS Lite, etc.).

Okay, enough with the boring details. More posts to come.

Update after meeting up with the tour group and having dinner:
