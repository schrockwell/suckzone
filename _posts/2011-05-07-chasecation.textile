May is upon us! We've already seen a very active year, as April saw one of the largest tornado outbreaks in history. Since then, the troposphere has been quiet. 

Too quiet. 

Nerve-wrackingly quiet.

Regardless of the state of the lowest part of our atmosphere, I'll be out there chasing it next week, sunny or stormy. Joining me for her first chasing experience will be my partner in crime, Jess. On Wednesday, I'm leaving Amherst, MA for Kansas City. Jess flies there on Saturday morning, and from there our weeklong trek begins.

After I complete my last exam on Monday morning, I will make final preparations for the chase. I will also make a ritual animal sacrifice or two, to appease the gods responsibile for tornados: Moisture, Instability, Lift, and Shear.
