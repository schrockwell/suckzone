Another graduation, another chase tour.

It's official: this year's chase vacation is another whirlwind tour of the Great Plains with "Silver Lining Tours":http://silverliningtours.com/. I'll be on Tour 5, chasing from June 6 - 11, based out of Denver. Chasing with SLT in 2006 was very rewarding - my storm photography since then has never rivaled what I was able to capture on even that marginal chase week. 

Plus, Roger is the freakin' man. I can't wait to get out there again.

In honor of this event, I updated the entire Suck Zone site, porting over all my posts and pictures from the old blog "Storm Chasing for Dummies". Now everything is in one place and, more importantly, sorted chronologically for easy reading.
