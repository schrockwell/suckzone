Well, the 2005 convention in Denver was a huge success. I got to meet a ton of prolific chasers... Tim Marshall, Tim Samaras, Tim Vasquez (the three Tims), Roger Hill, etc. etc. I met many people from the Stormtrack forums and IRC channel, also. What a great time. To top it all off, I won the grand prize in the raffle: "an XM WXWORX system":http://www.wxworx.com/! Wow, I can't wait to use this beast.

There are "some pictures here":http://www.stormexplorer.com/2005_NSCC/2005_NSCC.htm.

Props to Roger Hill and Dave Drummond for putting on one killer convention, and to Baron Services for raffling off the XM system!
