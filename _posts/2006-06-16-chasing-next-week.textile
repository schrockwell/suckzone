Finally! The time has come! I leave for chasing with "Silver Lining Tours":http://silverliningtours.com/ tomorrow. We will be chasing from Sunday through to next Friday. Hopefully this nuclear ridge that has held in place for the past month will move on and hopefully the mid-level winds and moisture levels pick up by the end of the week.

I will be posting to this blog very often. In addition to regular posts and pictures when I find Internet access, I will also be recording voice messages while we're on the road, so check the blog often during the upcoming week.
